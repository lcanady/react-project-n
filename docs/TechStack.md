# Tech Stack - Nicholas Hubbard (WAI 09/01/2020)

Fill out the headings below with your familiarly and comfort level with each piece of technology.


## Adobe XD

You are going to be using XD to create click-through designs of your application. It is recommended that you use an UI kit for a visual framework to help you design your applications as similarly to the potential live version as possible.

**How comfortable do you feel with XD?**
Over the course of FullSail, I have become comfortable with Adobe XD.  I still run into some issues and there are a lot of tricks that I need to learn, but I would say that I am at an intermediate level.  I have been able to use XD multiple times in my courses and have produced some pretty good wireframes and prototypes.

**What are your concerns around using XD?**
The concerns I have using XD is changing the wireframe version into a working prototype that follows my style guide.  I run into issues with typography sizing when changing from a desktop to a phone.  I also run into issues trying to figure out how to get the scrolling feature to work properly.  The biggest concern I have is when creating a logo and having to transfer it from Illustrator to XD or when trying to pull vectors from the internet and using them in XD.  Even though this is a concern, I feel that overall, I don't have many concerns regarding XD.

## React

You will be utilizing React as your front-end framework. You will be expected to use moduleCSS, PropTypes, and an ESLint style guide.

**How comfortable do you feel with React?**
React was very tough to grasp at the start with the use of components and having HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all in on area.  I feel that I am comfortable with reading the code within React and understanding how it works.  

**What are your concerns around using React?**
The last time I used React was 2 months ago before I took a break from school.  COVID has caused a lot of extra work for me in the real world.  With these 2 months off, I feel that I am going to be rusty for a little bit and it will take time to get all of React, Redux, and Node back in my brain.  I will need a good refresher to feel more at ease with building an app from ground up with React.

## Redux

Redux will be used to control your data and have proper data flow for your app. You will be expected to create well organized reducers, well built actions, and connected components.

**How comfortable do you feel with Redux?**
With just learning Redux for 1 week 2 months ago, I would say I am not very comfortable yet.  I need a lot more time understanding how reducers and actions work.  I love the concept and I feel once I learn Redux, it will become a great arsenal for the future.

**What are your concerns around using Redux?**
The main concern I have for Redux is learning how it all fits in with React talking to NodeJs.  From my last couple of assignments in ASL, I understood what was happening, but didn't really get how it was happening.  I am concerned that I won't fully grasp it during the rest of my time at FullSail.

## Node

You will be using Node as your server for both your API and to render your front-end. You will be required to use best practices, npm, and npx.

**How comfortable do you feel with Node?**
I like that Node is still JavaScript at the core, so I understand how to read it fairly well.  I understand how to use npm, npx, and how it talks with the front-end (React).  I would say that I am about 50% comfortable right now compared to the must lower percentage of Redux.

**What are your concerns around using Node?**
Node has its nuances compared to Vanilla JS and I feel that I get lost in how certain areas are different.  I write the wrong structure a lot and overdue it sometimes.  I need more time to harness my skills using Node. 

## Express

You will be using express as your framework for your API. You will be using and building middleware, routes, controllers, sending and receiving JSON data.

**How comfortable do you feel with Express?**
The MVC model is an easy concept to grasp.  I didn't have many issues in class understand how everything works, it was more just the execution.  I am comfortable with how each area works, but applying is tough.

**What are your concerns around using Express?**
My main concern is applying each area within Express, be it the middleware or routes.  Middleware and routes gave me the biggest headaches in ASL.  When you have one thing not working, you have to track between 5-15 steps to find what is not working.  Fixing one error creates 10 more.  I know the more I use these programs/languages/frameworks, the better I will get, but I am concerned that within the stressful timeline of FullSail and with my 50 hour work weeks, it will be extremely tough. 

## SQL/Posgres/Sequelize

You will be utilizing a relational database with Sequelize as an ORM. You will be creating migrations, models, and seeds as well utilizing the models with full validated CRUD.

**How comfortable do you feel with Sequelize?**
I understand the database language and it comes easy to me.  Sequelize is a little more tough to understand due to the variance in language.  It has its own way with talking to Node and express.  

**What are your concerns around using Sequelize?**
I am concerned with never fully grasping just how it works behind the scenes.  My over analyzing of these languages and programs makes it very tough to fully grasp.  

** Note: This is my second attempt to make sure the branch worked.  It deleted the branch after first cloning the repo.  It saved the information to the dev branch and not the tech-stack.
