## Application Definition Statement

*A* *clear* *high-level summary should be used to introduce the concept. This should be similar to an elevator pitch or a conversational reply to* *"What* *are you building?* *You will explore the audience and their demographics, the problem they are having, and your solution in subsequent sections in more detail but touch on them here.* 

Many members in the Air Force struggle with their specialty, additional duties, leadership requirements, schooling, while also having to live up to the physical standards of the military.  More than 80,000 troops per year fail their Fitness Test.  The main culprits are the 1.5 mile run-time and the waist circumference.  I am building a workout application that will keep troops on target for their next Fitness Test.  This will help create a healthy lifestyle and a higher pass rate for Air Force standards.

## Target Market

*Using research, describe the people most likely to be utilizing your application. What are their ages, education level, employment sector, income level, hobbies, or any other defining characteristics that set them apart from other groups of people? Identifying specific groups will help drive application design choices.*

Air Force active duty members, especially those who struggle with Fitness, will be the main demographic for this application.  The age group for active duty military members is between 18 - 39, but most members who fail are between 18 - 34.  According to Military Times.com, "The pass rate since 2013 has been 85% of troops out of a possible 559,622 members."  That is over 80,000 troops failing their PT test.  Even though the Air Force has changed their requirments regarding waist measurements, there are still too many members failing their PT test, specifically the run and sit ups.  

Right now there are no other applications geared towards Air Force members other than a PT Calculator app.  Troops have to get above an overall score of 75% to have a passing score.  My target market will be specifically those who want to improve their score from failing to passing, or 75%-80% to an excellent score of greater than 90%.

## User Profile

*User profiles are a snapshot of an actual person and helps to open a window into the mind of an actual user and will provide insight while tailoring and refining interaction details to best fit your ideal users within your Target Market.*

The target User Profile for this type of application will be those that are wanting to better themselves with health and fitness.  To be more concrete, these are the members in the military or in life that are struggling to keep up their run times and over all muscle endurance.  Members failing their PT test or just getting over a 75% will be the main demographic.

## Use Cases

*Defining a typical use case or scenario that a user would be interacting with your application provides a fixed path of interaction that you can refine your users experience around. If a user wants to listen to some music during a workout does requiring them to clicking 10+ times make sense while they are impatiently trying to start their exercise regimen? Use cases help to think through how your application will commonly be used.*

This type of application will be a simplistic and straight to the point workout website that will help users find workouts that will help them get a better score on their test.  Most military sites are overly complicated and have way too much data on each page.  Keeping the scenario or cases simple will make it easier for the user to just dive in get started.

## Problem Statement

*In a few sentences explain the problem your target market is seeing that requires this project to be built. This will identify why is your application needed and needs to be supported by Primary Research.*

There is a problem with having the right avenue and ability to track their workouts and easily find workouts that will help their performance within the military.  Specifically finding workouts that can improved core and aerobic fitness.

## Pain Points

*Explain your audiences pain points that are contributing to their defined problem and their impact on the user. Primary Research should support your explanations.*

Having a job in the military is a stressful life, this means a lot of members are too stressed out to workout.  According to cnbc.com, "Enlisted military personnel have the most stressful job in the United States".  Having quicker workouts that don't feel like such a commitment will help steer the users into using this application.

## Solution Statement

*How is your project going to solve the problem outlined above? Consider the competing products in your market space. What makes your solution different from others attempts to solve the problem? How are you able to better solve the defined problem for your audience than your competition?*

Most websites would throw so much at their user and overwhelm them.  My website would stick to simplicity and quicker workouts that would help the member build their endurance and pass their PT test.  

## Competition

*What competing products exist to solve this or a similar problem? Identify and summarize competing products and how their approach to solving your identified problem differ from your own.*

- https://www.fitnessblender.com/ : This is a free website that entails a lot of different workouts, videos, and healthy lifestyle sections.  What they have that mine wont, is a lot of pay for workout plan set ups.  They seem like a free to use for a basic website, but as soon as you want to do anything else, you have to pay.  

- https://darebee.com/ : Darebee looks to be a hub of all kinds of workouts.  This looks like more of the site that I am trying to create.  Their main issue more looks at their style.  They have challenges, programs, articles on how to improve your fitness.  I would try to center mine more around the military.

- https://www.muscleandfitness.com/ : Muscle and Fitness is a more well known company that even has their own magazine.  This is definitely a great website for a great amount of information, but they more push for global viewing compared to a certain user.  If they did have a user, it would be males between 18-30.  

- https://www.onepeloton.com/app : Pelaton has taken over the biking realm with their amazing spin bike.  Even though this website is centered around biking and running, it mostly focuses just on that.  Their main user base are those looking to burn fat a build cardio skills.  This hits one main area for my problem area, but not the core/abs fitness section.   

- https://dailyburn.com/landing : Daily burn centers around a healthier lifestyle and transformation website.  This websites pushes a membership that will include you into more of a club that centers around a community.  My website would be taking more of a user only approach and will center more on just building a favorites list and have other avenues for military members

Overall most of these sites are very complex that usually have teams of developers keeping the site up and running.  They all push ads and look for memberships.  

## Key Features

*Define key features intended to provide solutions to specific problems and pain points you have identified. These key features should be specifically defined in response to problems / pain points. More generic features like User Authentication should not be defined here.*

- User Creation: Lets members create their own profiles without having to be receptible to emails.  This will make the user feel safe just creating a profile to track their workouts.

- Workout Videos: There will be a list of videos that members can add to their Favorites page.

- Workout Categories: Menu that holds an area for aerobics, muscle fitness, and core work.

- Favorites Page:  This will be the page that holds all of their saved workouts and videos for the member to use later.  

- Links to other sites:  There will be links to other sites where members can look into healthy eating, lifestyle changes, and mental health help.

## Integrations

*Identify what 3rd party APIs, data sets, or external integrations are planned for use and outline how you will use them transformatively. Provide links to their respective documentation and verify that your intended use complies with their Terms of Service.*

APIs will be used for the workouts and videos.  I am unsure of what 3rd party APIs I want to use at this time.  I will be researching this more throughout the coming weeks on what would fit best in my site.
